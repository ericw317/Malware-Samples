What this malware does:
This is a wiper variant malware. When run, it will delete every accessible file on the computer. After file deletion, it will start writing files to the computer until the drive is full, and then remove all those files it just created. Doing this makes the deleted files unrecoverable.

How to protect yourself from malware like this:
There are a few things you can do to protect yourself from malware similar to this.

1) Modifying user permissions
	- Important data should only be able to be accessed and modified with administrator permissions. Often times, wiper malware will not be able to delete files if the user doesn't have permissions to modify it.

2) Regularly backup your system
	- Create regular backups so you can restore your data in the event it gets wiped

3) File recovery
	- If you are able to stop the wiper malware before it begins overwriting data, you can use forensic software to recover the deleted data.
